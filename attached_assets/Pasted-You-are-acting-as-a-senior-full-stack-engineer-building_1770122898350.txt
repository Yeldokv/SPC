You are acting as a senior full‑stack engineer building a production‑ready prototype for a district‑level government innovation project.
PROJECT CONTEXT
Build a Digital Stray Dog Mapping & Management System intended for use by:
Citizens (to report stray dog sightings)
Local authorities (Animal Husbandry / Panchayat)
Veterinary teams & volunteers
The system must support real data, real maps, analytics, and admin workflows, but should avoid paid services and sensitive API keys. All advanced integrations can be mocked or simulated.
This is NOT a demo app. It must look and behave like a deployable product.

🧱 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Follow a 5‑Layer Architecture:
Citizen Interface Layer
Data & Backend Layer
Analytics & Mapping Layer
Authority & Operations Layer
Validation, Ethics & Readiness Layer
Each layer must be clearly represented in code structure.
🛠️ TECH STACK (YOU MUST USE THIS)
Frontend: React (Vite)
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: SQLite (via Prisma or Sequelize)
Maps: Leaflet.js
Charts: Chart.js or Recharts
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Auth: Simple role‑based auth (mocked, no OAuth)
Project must be monorepo:
/client
/server
/prisma (or db)
/README.md
🎨 UI / UX DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Color palette:
Primary: Deep Blue (#1e3a8a)
Accent: Green (#16a34a)
Warning / Risk: Red‑Orange (#dc2626)
Font: Inter / system‑ui
Layout:
Clean, government‑friendly
No flashy animations
Mobile‑first citizen views
Map legends must be clear and labeled
Every page must have a clear purpose
🔹 LAYER 1: CITIZEN INTERFACE (MUST BE COMPLETE)
Citizen Reporting Page
Build a complete reporting flow with:
GPS auto‑capture (browser geolocation)
Manual pin drop on map
Mandatory photo upload
Category selection:
Single stray dog
Group of dogs
Aggressive behavior
Injured dog
Optional description field
Submit button → saves to database
Success & error states
Additional Requirements
Mobile‑friendly UI
Prevent empty submissions
Warn on duplicate nearby reports (basic logic)
🔹 LAYER 2: DATA & BACKEND (CRITICAL)
Database Schema (MUST IMPLEMENT)
Tables must include:
Reports
id
latitude
longitude
category
description
image_path
created_at
status (pending / verified / closed)
Zones (computed hotspots)
Interventions
zone_id
type (ABC / vaccination)
date
notes
Backend API (Express)
Implement REST APIs for:
Create report
Fetch reports
Update report status
Fetch zones
Log intervention
Fetch analytics
All endpoints must be documented in README.
🔹 LAYER 3: ANALYTICS & MAPPING (WOW FACTOR)
Map & Heatmap Engine
Interactive Leaflet map
Heatmap layer using report density
Risk classification:
Low (green)
Medium (yellow)
High (red)
Auto update map when new data is added
Analytics Dashboard
Include:
Total reports count
Reports by category
Reports over time (line chart)
Top hotspot zones
Zone priority list (rule‑based)
Use real data from DB, not static values.
🔹 LAYER 4: AUTHORITY & OPERATIONS DASHBOARD
Admin Panel (Separate UI)
Mock login (admin role)
Table view of all reports
Filters:
Date
Category
Status
Map view with report pins
Ability to:
Verify report
Mark action taken
Close report
ABC / Vaccination Planning
Ability to mark zones as:
ABC completed
Vaccination completed
Show intervention history per zone
Visual indicators on map
🔹 LAYER 5: VALIDATION, ETHICS & READINESS
Verification & Trust
Manual admin verification flow
Status badges (pending / verified / closed)
Ethics & Welfare (MUST BE VISIBLE)
UI message stating:
“This system supports humane, ABC‑based management only”
No public visibility of reporter identity
No violent or punitive language anywhere
Feedback Loop
Simple feedback form
Store feedback in DB
📊 DATA REQUIREMENTS
Generate realistic seed data:
150–300 reports
Multiple zones
Time‑spread entries
Ensure heatmaps and charts look realistic
📁 CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
Clean folder structure
Meaningful variable names
Comments where logic is non‑obvious
No hard‑coded secrets
App must run with:
npm install
npm run dev
📘 README (MANDATORY)
Include:
Project overview
Architecture explanation
Features list
Tech stack
How to run locally
What is simulated vs real
Future funding‑phase features
🚫 DO NOT IMPLEMENT (IMPORTANT)
Paid APIs
SMS / WhatsApp alerts
Government DB integrations
AI image recognition
OAuth / Aadhaar
Mention them only as future enhancements.
🎯 GOAL
At the end, this project must look like:
A deployable civic tech platform
Execution‑heavy, not conceptual
Worthy of district‑level selection
Ready to scale with funding
Proceed step‑by‑step, creating working code for each layer.
