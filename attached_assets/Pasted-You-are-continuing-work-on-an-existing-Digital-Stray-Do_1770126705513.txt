You are continuing work on an existing Digital Stray Dog Mapping & Management System.
OBJECTIVE
Upgrade the system to support a hierarchical, role‑based authentication and authorization model suitable for local‑body‑level government operations, while maintaining data integrity and preventing false or garbage reports.
The authentication system must be simple, secure, and realistic, but OTP/SMS gateways can be mocked.

🔐 AUTHENTICATION MODEL (MANDATORY)
Implement a single authentication system with mobile number–based login, and role‑based access control (RBAC).
Login Method (All Users)
Mobile number login (10 digits)
OTP verification
OTP logic can be mocked (static OTP or console‑logged)
No email login
No anonymous access
This is required to:
Reduce fake reports
Improve accountability
Align with government‑style systems
👥 USER ROLES & HIERARCHY (VERY IMPORTANT)
Implement the following roles, with strict permission boundaries.
1️⃣ Citizen User (Default Role)
Who: General public

Login using mobile number
Submit stray dog reports
View general hotspot map (read‑only)
Track status of their own reports
Submit feedback
Restrictions:
Cannot view reporter details of others
Cannot see admin dashboards
Cannot modify reports after submission
2️⃣ Local Body Official (LSGI / Panchayat / Municipality)
Who: Government employees at local body level
Each official must be mapped to a specific local body.

Access & Capabilities:

View reports only within their jurisdiction
Verify citizen reports
Update report status (action taken / closed)
Mark ABC / vaccination activities in their area
View local analytics (their area only)
Restrictions:
Cannot access other local bodies’ data
Cannot manage users
Cannot change system rules
3️⃣ District / Department Admin
Who: Higher‑level Animal Husbandry / coordinating authority
Access & Capabilities:

View data across all local bodies
Compare hotspot trends between regions
Monitor ABC & vaccination coverage
View performance analytics of local bodies
Restrictions:
Cannot modify system configuration
Cannot delete data
4️⃣ System Admin (Project Team / Platform Owners)
Who: You / core team
Access & Capabilities (Full Control):

Create & manage local bodies
Assign officials to local bodies
Manage user roles
Access all dashboards
Override report status (with audit log)
View system‑wide analytics
Manage feedback & abuse reports
🧩 DATABASE CHANGES (MANDATORY)
Extend the database schema with:
Users Table
id
mobile_number
role (citizen / local_official / district_admin / system_admin)
local_body_id (nullable)
created_at
last_login
Local Bodies Table
id
name
type (Panchayat / Municipality / Corporation)
district
boundary_reference (can be mocked)
Audit Logs Table
action
performed_by
target_entity
timestamp
🖥️ UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
Login Flow
Single login screen
Role determined automatically after login
Redirect user to role‑specific dashboard
Dashboards
Citizen Dashboard
Local Body Dashboard
District Dashboard
System Admin Dashboard
Each dashboard must:
Show only relevant data
Hide inaccessible routes
Display role clearly (badge / header)
🔒 SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY RULES
All backend routes must enforce role checks
No frontend‑only security
Prevent cross‑local‑body access
Soft‑delete only (no hard deletes)
All admin actions logged
🧠 ADDITIONAL HIGH‑VALUE FEATURES (ADD THESE)
Report Credibility Scoring
Score reports based on:
Verified user
Photo present
Report frequency
Display score to admins only
Abuse & Spam Control
Flag excessive reporting from same user
Allow admin to temporarily disable a user
Log abuse actions
Transparency Indicators
Show “Verified by Local Body” badge
Show “Action Taken” timeline (non‑sensitive)
🚫 CONSTRAINTS
No real SMS gateway
No Aadhaar / govt auth
No paid auth services
OTP can be mocked
📘 DOCUMENTATION UPDATE
Update README to include:
Role hierarchy
Access control rules
Mocked OTP explanation
Governance alignment
🎯 FINAL GOAL
The system must now clearly demonstrate:
Accountability
Jurisdiction‑based governance
Reduced false reporting
Readiness for real government deployment
Proceed by modifying existing code without breaking earlier features.
